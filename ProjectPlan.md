# **SQA Project Plan**

Each team member will take responsibility for a minimum of two topics, working closely with their partner to ensure that the work is critcally analysed and of the best possibble quality: 

- **Task Estimation in Scrums** – Lauren Kearney & Damian Gluszkiewicz

- **Coding Standards** – Benjamin Nolan & Lauren Kearney

- **Code Reviews** – Damian Gluszkiewicz and Benjamin Nolan

Each topic will feature five high-quality resources connected to the issue, such as blogs and articles, from which our group will extract common topics to discuss.

The duos must first pick the resources they will use for the topics, as well as what they will discuss in each resource.

Git Flow standards will be adheard to during the duration of the project, each pair must create their own branch in order to avoid conflicts on the same file, chnages will be commited regularly and a review will be made before merging back into the develop branch.
