What are code reviews?

A code review consists of one member of a group checking over another group members code, the aim of a peer to peer code review is to identify mistakes, catch eary bugs or areas for improvement in terms of code efficiency. When performing a source code review code should be broken into small sections of no more than 400 lines and no more than 60 minutes should be assigned to the review of each section. The implementation of code reviews into a teams standard practices is one of the cheapest ways to reduct bugs at early stages, it is a crusial part of software quality assurance and provides a wide range of benefits within the development lifecycle.   


Why should we implement code reviews?

• The quality of the code improves and as a result efficient collaboration is easier to acheive.
• Helps to identify bugs and inefficiencies at early development stages which saves time and money in the long term
• Adds a level of consistency in the design and implementation of the code 
• Knowledge is shared between the developers who are writing and reviewing the code which helps the developers build their skill set. 
• Code reviews help to spread the ownership of the code, it is easy for a team member to continously be assigned the same kind of task because "it's what they're good at". By implementing code reviews all team members become comfortable with all aspects of the development lifecycle.
