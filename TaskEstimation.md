# Task Estimation in Scrum
Task Estimation refers to measuring the effort, time, and cost associated with a project. In project management, estimating the project's scope is the most important step. No matter how big or small the project is, estimating it well can ease execution throughout the project execution cycle. Most of the time the success or failure of a project depends on the estimate. It's often challenging for software developers to estimate projects since it's frequently done with incomplete information or incorrect information. Below are some common challenges associated with project estimation.

## Challenges 

**1. Poor design**

Even when the best efforts are made, a poor design is the root cause of failure. People create a tight design based on a requirements document, which they misinterpret as being frozen. Moreover, they do not take the time to make the design scalable. Poor design causes unnecessary tweaking of code and heavy maintenance that can push schedules to the limit. 

**2. Not factoring the dependencies right**

In many projects, a decision point or external dependency is overlooked, which causes the project to suffer. A clear understanding of mandatory, discretionary, and external dependencies can help you plan the schedule efficiently. 

**3. How much buffer is the right amount?**

The correct buffer to pad an estimate is a common issue for Project Managers. Although 20% padding is usually done, the best figure is determined by the skillsets of the team and the complexity of the project. 

**4. The risk of analogous estimation**

An estimate for a project is typically made using an expert's judgement or based on experience. Picking an analogy and mapping the estimate might sound intuitive, but it is often risky due to the unique characteristics and dependencies in every project, the people involved, and their skillset, various tools and technologies adopted, and the infrastructure and resources made available. 

**5. Estimation Person**

When estimation is not done by the developer or in cooperation with the developer, it can result in huge disparities between the estimate and the actual result. 

**6. Software requirements are not set in stone**

Customers expect a product that is constantly changing in an ever-changing landscape. Furthermore, they are also subject to information overload, and sometimes they don't know what they want to do. Additional feature requests can arrive at any time and affect your current development plans.

It is evident that there are many difficulties when it comes to task estimation. However, the estimation process can be reliable if certain basic principles are followed: 

## Solutions 

**1. Use Past Knowledge**

Look for input from people who have done similar work before, but only use the information as a guide. Every project is different when thinking about technology, integration points, and priorities. Use the information from past estimates to see what has changed and how it affects this attempt.
